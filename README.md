# Currently a WIP

~~My plan is to use that data as a base in hopes to create a RESTful API for Pokémon cards. It will contain images, card/set info, etc.~~

Turns out that a Pokémon card API already [exists](https://github.com/PokemonTCG). Nonetheless, I will still use this repo to create my own version of a Pokémon card API and make the SQLite DB available for download. It will crawl the [Official Pokémon TCG DB](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-tcg/pokemon-cards/)

At the moment all that's written is a crawler for [pokellector](http://pokecollector.com), but aforementioned that will be changed to the official TCG DB.
