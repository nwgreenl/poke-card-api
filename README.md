# Currently a WIP

~~My plan is to use that data as a base in hopes to create a RESTful API for Pok√©mon cards. It will contain images, card/set info, etc.~~

Turns out that a Pok√©mon card API already [exists](https://github.com/PokemonTCG). Nonetheless, I will still use this repo to create a SQLite DB along with some fun analysis. It will scrape the [Official Pok√©mon TCG DB](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-tcg/pokemon-cards/)

At the moment all that's written is a scraper for Pok√©mon type cards. Will be working on trainer and energy card types soon. Will also be cleaning up all the tech debt things üòÖ
